# IP-Debugger
A app that that I'm working on that allows you to send packages to any ip(e.g: Server, Network, or Device. Must be running Windows.) This is still a WIP so some things wont work... Yet. This was made in C#, Also cheers to my friend Sebastian(https://github.com/sebastianwhiffen) for teaching me C#, and helping me with stuff... And also with BL2.
